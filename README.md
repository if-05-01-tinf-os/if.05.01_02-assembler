- A text editor (take care that the line ending is set to UNIX format, i.e., line feed (LF) only).
- nba to assemble your programs.
- NbmGui to run and debug your programs.

## Required Tasks
1. Create a folder `Solutions` to your repository. Place all assembler files you create for the next tasks into this directory.
1. **Percentage calculator:** Write an assembler program `percentage_calculator.na` which is asking the user for the maximum number of points to be achieved and the points actually achieved. The program then outputs how many percent the user got.
2. **Counter:** Write an assembler program `counter.na` which prints the numbers from 1 to n in a loop. n is entered by the user.
